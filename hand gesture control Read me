just built something exciting — a Hand Gesture Control System using Python, OpenCV, and Google’s MediaPipe! 🖐️✨

📌 What it does:
Detects hand movements in real-time using my laptop’s webcam 🎥
Tracks 21 hand landmarks with a pre-trained ML model (CNN-based)
Allows you to control your computer with just your hands (move mouse, click, or even control media)
A perfect mix of machine learning + rule-based logic

📌 Where ML is used:
MediaPipe’s deep learning model detects the hand and key landmarks.
I built logic on top of these landmarks to map gestures → actions.

📌 Why it’s exciting:
No external sensors or devices needed, just a webcam!
Can be used in gaming 🎮, presentations 📽️, media control 🎧, or accessibility 🖥️.
This is just the start — next step is to train a custom gesture classifier to make it even smarter.

💡 Projects like these are a great way to blend AI, computer vision, and real-world interaction.

👉 Curious to try it out? Let’s connect — I’d love to collaborate on similar ideas in AI, CV, and Human-Computer Interaction.
